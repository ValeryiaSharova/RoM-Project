# Roulette of marks

Roulette of marks is a website for survey students on the lectures. The name of student is chosen by random, and the question is given consistently from the list. As a result of the answer, you can put marks: good, so-so and bad. When a student has five answers, website gives him a mark. It significantly makes easy the survey and allows you to be not biased.
